# Golang Basics
## Conventionally follow this:
- Initialize golang module in indepedent golang project folders
```
go mod init <module-name>
eg go mod init my-project
```

- In Golang folder where you initilize the module it is called the main package (like a folder)
- In the main packahe have a main.go with a main function which will be the entry point of the program
